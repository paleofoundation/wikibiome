# WikiBiome post-cutover closeout

This is the operational record for the custom-domain observation window that
began August 31, 2026. It is deliberately separate from feature development.
The WikiBiome control task is the only production integration and release
owner.

## Authority and safety boundary

- Preserve the legacy Vercel rollback target through at least September 7,
  2026.
- Do not delete, alter, deploy, push, merge, change DNS, initiate a payment,
  change account data, or retire the rollback target from this closeout task.
- A passing audit does not authorize retirement. Retirement requires a new,
  explicit user approval after the audit report is delivered.
- The earliest closeout audit time is **2026-09-07T00:00:00+03:00**
  (Asia/Nicosia; **2026-09-06T21:00:00Z**).

## Baseline: September 1, 2026

Captured read-only at **2026-09-01T12:10:32+03:00**. This is a pre-gate
baseline, not the final go/no-go audit.

### Source and production identity

| Item | Baseline evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Closeout worktree | Clean, detached at `2b6444ce10123038126954c428e6a025a32fe9e4` (`main` at task creation) |
| Sites project | `appgprj_6a952a45833881918318478cf66804f3`, active and public |
| Production release | Sites version 40, commit `bffbcf093d1c553fb33728be0d1d04fc8d717f47`, deployment `appgdep_6a9682e40a8881919aaaaf19db6b2e6c` (control-thread deployment record) |
| Newer saved version | Version 41 exists at commit `2b6444ce10123038126954c428e6a025a32fe9e4`; it was not treated as the production baseline because saved versions are not necessarily deployed and the live route shape matches version 40 |
| Custom domains | `wikibiome.com` and `www.wikibiome.com` both report domain, provider, and SSL status `active`; no provider error |

### DNS and TLS

| Check | Baseline evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Apex DNS | `wikibiome.com A 172.66.3.26`, `162.159.143.30` |
| `www` DNS | `www.wikibiome.com CNAME custom-domains.chatgpt.site.` |
| Apex HTTP behavior | `200`, serves the homepage directly, and emits canonical `https://www.wikibiome.com`; it does **not** redirect to `www` in this baseline |
| `www` HTTP behavior | `200` at `https://www.wikibiome.com/` |
| `www` certificate | Google Trust Services `WE1`; SAN `www.wikibiome.com`; valid 2026-08-31 18:24:58Z through 2026-11-29 19:24:52Z; SHA-256 `BB:E9:28:E8:85:5D:48:74:AF:1F:52:0F:95:63:23:E6:20:DF:06:74:C7:D3:42:47:82:48:C5:34:90:8F:A6:76` |
| Apex certificate | Google Trust Services `WE1`; SAN `wikibiome.com`; valid 2026-08-31 19:48:06Z through 2026-11-29 20:48:05Z; SHA-256 `C9:DC:31:39:0B:47:A1:DD:9D:E5:8F:76:FA:3D:D8:B4:07:C3:18:AC:8C:14:F9:AE:27:9F:A4:DE:33:48:D7:A7` |

### Representative route baseline

Read-only requests were captured at **2026-09-01T09:08:21Z**.

| Surface | Route | Baseline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Home | `/` | `200`, correct title |
| Category | `/category/microbe` | `200`, Microorganisms title |
| Article | `/article/nickel` | `200`, exact article canonical |
| Source | `/source/ahmed-2025-metals-alzheimers-mechanistic-review` | `200` |
| Search | `/search?q=nickel` | `200` |
| Support | `/support` | `200`, contains the configured Stripe Payment Link |
| Thank-you | `/support/thank-you` | `200` |
| Contribution entry | `/contribute` | `200` |
| Owner contribution ledger | `/contributions` | `307` to `/signin-with-chatgpt?return_to=%2Fcontributions`; no account data changed |
| Knowledge graph | `/explore?focus=nickel` | `200` |
| Clusters | `/clusters?condition=alzheimers-disease` | `200` |
| Comparison | `/compare?a=alzheimers-disease&b=parkinsons-disease` | `200` |
| Keystone | `/keystone` | `200` |
| Sitemap | `/sitemap.xml` | `200`, XML, 2,644 `<url>` entries |
| Robots | `/robots.txt` | `200`, advertises `https://www.wikibiome.com/sitemap.xml` |

All 15 representative public WikiBiome endpoints above returned `200`. The
protected contribution ledger exposed the expected sign-in boundary. Owner
authentication and moderation were not exercised because this baseline must
not change account data; they require an authenticated, read-only browser check
after the time gate.

Two newer researcher-network routes present in commit `2b6444c`
(`/researcher/dashboard` and `/researcher/moderation`) returned `404` on the
version-40 production baseline. They are recorded as unpublished feature state,
not as a cutover regression. The final audit must test the moderation surface
that is actually live after any control-task releases before September 7.

### Canonical baseline

- The homepage and Nickel article emitted the expected canonical URLs.
- Ten representative non-home HTML routes (category, source, search, support,
  thank-you, contribution entry, Explore, Clusters, Compare, and Keystone)
  emitted `https://www.wikibiome.com` instead of their own route canonical.
- The apex serves duplicate homepage content with a `www` canonical instead of
  redirecting.

These are search-continuity risks owned by the separate search-visibility
program. They must be rechecked in the post-gate audit; this closeout task does
not patch or publish them.

### Stripe support baseline

Read-only Stripe API inspection targeted the already specified live account,
**Microbiome Signatures LLC** (`acct_1T5vhlRiEhjlKM3G`). No Checkout Session or
payment was created.

| Item | Baseline evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Payment Link | `plink_1UAXxqRiEhjlKM3GJQ5UH0L8`, active, live |
| Public URL | `https://buy.stripe.com/bJefZjaif6IFd8Z4PL6EU03`, returns `200` |
| Model | One-time, customer-chosen USD amount |
| Amount bounds | $5 minimum, $10 preset, $2,500 maximum |
| Return routing | `https://wikibiome.com/support/thank-you` |
| Site return route | Returns `200` without initiating payment |

### Worker-log baseline

The Sites production worker was queried read-only with `errors_only=true` for
the preceding 1,440 minutes (maximum 100 events). The connector returned 17
failure-filtered events spanning **2026-09-01T08:06:48.514Z** through
**2026-09-01T08:55:53.107Z**:

- `0` 5xx responses;
- `0` logged errors;
- `0` exception/uncaught/unhandled signals;
- `17` outcome `ok`, informational `404` responses.

The 404s were favicon requests (5), two nonexistent article slugs (6), source
map probes (4), and one probe each for `/open/visitors/info/gets` and
`/.git/HEAD`. This is the available log window, not a claim of unlimited
historical coverage.

### Search-index baseline

Three public search queries were run:

- `site:www.wikibiome.com WikiBiome`
- `site:www.wikibiome.com/article/nickel`
- `site:wikibiome.com "WikiBiome — The Human Microbiome Encyclopedia"`

They returned no results. There is therefore **no public search-result evidence
yet** that canonical `www.wikibiome.com` URLs have entered the index. Search
Console or Bing Webmaster evidence, if available to the owner, remains the
preferred authenticated evidence after the gate.

### Legacy rollback baseline

| Item | Baseline evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Vercel project | `wikibiome`, `prj_SCOrInaQ6NfUPSCDAhPxWJGm62LR`, team `team_qSB41Q0YIPL29XCzvsxgu91R` |
| Retained production deployment | `dpl_5ShUos99yjK3vWMbarbfmxkDQWEH` |
| Immutable URL | `https://wikibiome-kziwi715f-karen-pendergrass-projects.vercel.app` |
| Deployment state | `Ready`, production, created 2026-08-31T23:34:13+03:00 |
| Former `www` CNAME | `7d875abacccdc8f1.vercel-dns-016.com.` |
| Former target resolution | `216.150.1.193`, `216.150.16.193` |
| Alias metadata | Deployment still lists `wikibiome.com`, `www.wikibiome.com`, and the stable Vercel project aliases |
| Direct deployment access | Immutable URL exists and redirects to Vercel SSO; rollback readiness is supported by `Ready` state, retained domain aliases, and retained former CNAME, not by anonymous direct-deployment access |

No Vercel deployment, alias, or DNS state was changed.

## Post-gate audit checklist

Run on or after **2026-09-07T00:00:00+03:00** against the production release
then active. Preserve raw timestamps, status codes, final URLs, certificate
details, and account/log evidence.

- [ ] Record the exact production version, commit, and route corpus active at audit time.
- [ ] Verify apex and `www` DNS, HTTPS, certificate validity, redirect/canonical behavior, and absence of a redirect loop.
- [ ] Verify representative home, category, article, source, search, support, contribution, and research-tool routes in a real browser and by HTTP.
- [ ] Authenticate as the owner and confirm moderation availability read-only; do not submit, accept, decline, edit, or change account data.
- [ ] Confirm the live Stripe Payment Link, amount model, disclosure, and configured thank-you redirect via read-only API; do not create a Checkout Session or payment.
- [ ] Verify `/support/thank-you` directly.
- [ ] Verify sitemap content type, count, canonical-host samples, and robots sitemap declaration.
- [ ] Inspect the available recent production worker-log window for every 5xx, exception, uncaught error, or failed outcome; name unresolved events exactly.
- [ ] Capture public search results and, if owner access is available, Search Console/Bing URL or sitemap evidence for canonical `www` URLs.
- [ ] Re-inspect Vercel deployment `dpl_5ShUos99yjK3vWMbarbfmxkDQWEH` and former CNAME `7d875abacccdc8f1.vercel-dns-016.com.`.
- [ ] Produce the standardized handoff: final commit SHA(s), baseline-to-final metric delta, changed files, commands/tests, representative rendered/live checks, blockers/account gates, and rollback notes.
- [ ] Issue a go/no-go recommendation with exact blockers.
- [ ] If and only if the audit passes, request new explicit approval for retirement. Do not perform retirement in the audit turn.

## Decision rule

Recommend **NO-GO** if any required hostname or representative route fails,
owner moderation cannot be confirmed, Stripe/thank-you routing is unavailable,
sitemap or robots is invalid, an unresolved production 5xx/exception remains,
no credible indexing evidence is available, or the rollback deployment/CNAME
information is unavailable.

Recommend **GO FOR AN EXPLICIT RETIREMENT DECISION** only when every required
check is evidenced. That recommendation still performs no retirement action.
